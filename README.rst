``python-pushover-open-client``
===============================

    Command line app and framework for receiving Pushover push notifications in real time

.. _pyscaffold-notes:

Features
========

* Receive notifications real time
* Execute python funcions via commands received by notification, passing arguments
* Execute shell commands, passing arguments
* Execute python functions to all received notifications (eg,. you can use ``Popen`` to send all notifications to ``notify-send``.)

Installing
==========

    pip install python-pushover-open-client

Setting Up
==========

The script expects a file at the home directory named ``~/.pushover-open-client-creds.json``. The file should be a JSON file with account's ``email`` and ``password``, this way:

file: ``~/.pushover-open-client-creds.json``
--------------------------------------------

::

  {
    "email": "USERS@EMAIL.ETC",
    "password": "M4HSUP3RBPASS"
  }

Given the above, by logging and getting an auth secret, a new device will be created wielding it's device_id, and that file will be updated containing all these four values.

Using
=====

Programatically
---------------

Soon.. Example is better. Decorators ``@register_command`` etc .

Contributing
============

Please open an issue if you want to contribute with code.


Support
=======

You can open a issue or a message in discussions for support in using/getting the code.

Is it ready already?
====================

No, not really, but will be soon. All steps of the app are already implemented, almost all is done.

Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.1.4. For details and usage
information on PyScaffold see https://pyscaffold.org/.
